## An interactive visualisation of the claims in *Age of Em*.

It will be a graph of clickable nodes, each representing one claim.

The point is to make his (often vague) critics specify exactly where their models (or modelling philosophies) diverge.

The dataset is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wPNvIqjDglk7cWaSlG8ZOt2HjAJTx_19iTHu8w9T8s/edit?usp=sharing). (There will be a version without my editorialising too.)

I'm more interested in the book as a repository of probably-true social science about past and present.

## Obvious extensions

* *Parse the whole book*. This database only includes the claims in the analytical index on [ageofem.com].
* *Probabilism*. Rather than first-order logic, redo with sliders underneath each claim, and a set neural threshold for reaching implication.
* *Persistence*. Save your as json and share to clarify disagreements.
